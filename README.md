# GM8_game-manager-tool
game manager made with game maker 8... made with frustration bc the engine of my ps2 died recently so. here i am.

DO NOT EXPECT THAT IM GOING TO FIX THAT SHIT WHEN YOU CLOSE A GAME MANUALLY INSTEAD WITH BUTTON COMBINATION. (do not, but maybe i will)

keyboard?
what the fuck is that?
i only know about joysticks....
and do not expect that tho....

the key combination is:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPIvaN4PoIo
okno that is the ""preview"".

the key combination is: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8. or if its hard for you: triangle+circle+square+cross+L1+L2+R1+R2.

have fun.

still here?. its not that hard to modify the settings.dat or is it?

literally made it for babies.

okaaaaaaaaay...

1. image for icon
2. title
3. game location
4. roms location (leave empty, only for emulators with--> .exe <gamerom.gba>)
5. process name (to kill it with key combination and allow to come back to game manager, if you hate game manager so much then delete it, wash your eyes and give them fire for 50 seconds. then d- okno. love you :3)
